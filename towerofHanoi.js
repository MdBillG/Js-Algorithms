// ðŸ”¹ What is Tower of Hanoi?

// You have 3 rods (pegs): source, auxiliary, and destination.

// You have N disks, all different sizes, stacked in ascending order on the source rod (largest at the bottom, smallest at the top).

// Goal: Move all disks from the source rod to the destination rod.

// Rules:

// Only one disk can be moved at a time.

// A move means taking the top disk from one rod and placing it on another rod.

// You cannot place a larger disk on top of a smaller disk.
